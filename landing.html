								<p>This is the e-portfolio reflective piece for what I have put together during my Security and Risk Management module under Professor Sabeen Tahir.

									<p> Within the Initial Risk assessment, I worked alongside a group member and we decided to both carry out independent Risk Assessments of the brick-and-mortar pet food company "Pampered Pets". We had to assess the company's risk as they were and in a scenario where they chose to digitalize their business. I created the Risk Assessment of the Company as it was, using the NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1 Risk Assessment Model.</p>

									<P> With the Executive Summary, I worked alone and made use of the Monte Carlo Method of performing a quantitative risk assessment of potential product defect rates and supply chain issues   </P>

												<h3>Initial Risk Assessment</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For the risk assessment of pampered pets as it currently stands, the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1” Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments” was chosen. This is due to NIST SP 800-30 being a structured and well documented risk assessment approach that allows for flexibility in the scope and analysis of risk. This assessment will be qualitative due to lack of numerical information. This assessment will make assumptions and statements based on information provided.
											
											1) Identifying Assets:
Technical Assets: 
-POS Computer
-Old Networked warehouse Computer with spreadsheet of warehouse deliveries and item locations.
-Wireless Hub and Gateway used by both computers and employees mobile devices
-Company Email for orders
Information Assets: Customer Data, Financial Records and Supplier Information.
Intangible Assets: Brand reputation for high quality pet food
2) Identifying Threat Sources:
-Hackers
-Trusted Insider
-Competitors
-Environmental
3) Identifying Potential Threats:
Cyber Threats: 
-Phishing attacks to company email
-Unauthorized Access to customer and financial data
-Wireless attacks(Sniffing, Session Hijacking, Denial of Service, etc..)
-Unauthorized Access of Web Gateway(Default Credentials)
-Exploits on old, likely unpatched computers.
-Insider Attack(Accidental or Intentional)

Operational Threats:
-Disruption to the supply chain 
-Employee Errors when entering data into spreadsheet
4) Identifying and predisposing conditions:
The following will contain assumptions of potential vulnerabilities based on information provided. In order to have a more comprehensive and accurate vulnerability list it is recommended to perform vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and review of configurations.

Technical Vulnerabilities:
●Legacy Systems: The old networked computer in the warehouse is likely to have an outdated operating system, unpatched software and outdated security measures making it vulnerable to attack.
●Wireless Network: Using the same wireless network for business operations and personal use by employees increases the attack surface and vulnerability to network attacks.
●Default Credentials: If the wireless hub and gateway are using default credentials, this poses a significant risk of unauthorized access.
●Unpatched Systems: Both the POS computer and the warehouse computer may have unpatched software vulnerabilities.
Operational Vulnerabilities:
●Manual Processes: Reliance on manual data entry for tracking warehouse deliveries can lead to errors and inefficiencies.
●Supply Chain Dependency: The business's dependence on local suppliers and employee vehicles for transporting ingredients is a vulnerability. Any disruption (e.g., vehicle breakdown, supplier issues) can significantly impact operations.

												<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Summary of recommendations
Based on the above, it is within Pampered Pet’s best interest to first set up a diverse supplier portfolio with quality assurance to avoid large scale supply chain disruptions. Following this, the company should secure their supply chain to ensure it does not become an attack vector for cyberattacks. Lastly, the company should work on quality control solutions such as continuous improvement measures and 2 person review to ensure that quality is maintained for products leaving the automated warehouses.</p>
