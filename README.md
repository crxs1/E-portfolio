Risk Assessment:


"
Part 1: Current Business Risk Assessment
For the risk assessment of pampered pets as it currently stands, the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1” Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments” was chosen. This is due to NIST SP 800-30 being a structured and well documented risk assessment approach that allows for flexibility in the scope and analysis of risk. This assessment will be qualitative due to lack of numerical information. This assessment will make assumptions and statements based on information provided.

1) Identifying Assets:
Technical Assets: 
POS Computer
Old Networked warehouse Computer with spreadsheet of warehouse deliveries and item locations.
Wireless Hub and Gateway used by both computers and employees mobile devices
Company Email for orders
Information Assets: Customer Data, Financial Records and Supplier Information.
Intangible Assets: Brand reputation for high quality pet food

2) Identifying Threat Sources:
Hackers
Trusted Insider
Competitors
Environmental

3) Identifying Potential Threats:

Cyber Threats: 
Phishing attacks to company email
Unauthorized Access to customer and financial data
Wireless attacks(Sniffing, Session Hijacking, Denial of Service, etc..)
Unauthorized Access of Web Gateway(Default Credentials)
Exploits on old, likely unpatched computers.
Insider Attack(Accidental or Intentional)

Operational Threats:
Disruption to the supply chain 
Employee Errors when entering data into spreadsheet


4) Identifying and predisposing conditions:
  The following will contain assumptions of potential vulnerabilities based on information provided. In order to have a more comprehensive and accurate     vulnerability list it is recommended to perform vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and review of configurations.

Technical Vulnerabilities:

Legacy Systems: The old networked computer in the warehouse is likely to have an outdated operating system, unpatched software and outdated security measures making it vulnerable to attack.

Wireless Network: Using the same wireless network for business operations and personal use by employees increases the attack surface and vulnerability to network attacks.

Default Credentials: If the wireless hub and gateway are using default credentials, this poses a significant risk of unauthorized access.

Unpatched Systems: Both the POS computer and the warehouse computer may have unpatched software vulnerabilities.

Operational Vulnerabilities:
Manual Processes: Reliance on manual data entry for tracking warehouse deliveries can lead to errors and inefficiencies.
Supply Chain Dependency: The business's dependence on local suppliers and employee vehicles for transporting ingredients is a vulnerability. Any disruption (e.g., vehicle breakdown, supplier issues) can significantly impact operations.

5) Threat Modeling (Overall risk based on assumed likelihood and impact)
